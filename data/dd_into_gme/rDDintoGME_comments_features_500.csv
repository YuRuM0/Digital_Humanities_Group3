If someone knows the source, please tell me so I can properly cite them.\n====================================\nThe difference between short interest and short volume\n\nThere has been a good deal of discussion back and forth here on the topics of ""short interest"" and ""short volume.""\xa0 I thought it might be helpful to shed some light on the important distinction between these two.\n\nThink of\xa0short interest\xa0as a ""photograph"" at a given point in time of the total number of shares held short as of that precise moment (most often, the end of a quarter or a month).\n\nThink of\xa0short volume\xa0as a ""movie"" covering the activity of a trading day (or longer period), which captures on film the total number of shares shorted during that day.\n\nAnd finally, think of the\xa0short volume percentage\xa0as the fraction that results from dividing the total number of shares shorted during that day by the total number of shares traded for that day.\n\nThe really critical point to understand here is that\xa0short volume\xa0for a given trading day or other period is not a number that can be added to existing short interest to derive the new short interest total.\xa0\xa0The reason for that is that the short volume on any given day measures only the shares shorted and takes no account of the share trades made to close short positions.\xa0 Most typically, a very high percentage of short trades will be closed on the same day resulting in a short interest at the end of the day that is little changed from the short interest at the beginning of that day.\n\nHow and why does this happen?\xa0 Welcome to the world of HFT (high-frequency trading), where the bots hit the market with a staccato of relatively small trades, the net effect of which is to drive the SP down on moderately low volume.\xa0 At that point (or on closely following days), shares are purchased at the new, lower prices to close out the shorts.\xa0 So the net change in\xa0short interest\xa0is often very small even when the\xa0short volume\xa0is very large.', ""I seem to recall someone saying the daily figures weren't cumulative.

Germany is traditionally not a ‚Äúshareholder nation‚Äù.\n\n79.6M shares / 41.14 shares per shareholder ‚âà 1.93M shareholders, which would be 36.4% of all Germans that have owned stocks (of any company) in 2020!\n\nI doubt that the number of GME shares held by me and my fellow Germans are anywhere close to that. I conservatively assume that maybe 2-3% of those 5.3M shareholding Germans hold GME shares, which would be in the ballpark of 100k-160k German GME shareholders.\n\n\nData source: https://www.dai.de/fileadmin/user_upload/210225_Aktionaerszahlen_2020.pdf p.5\n\nEdit: u/holzbrett I appreciate your edits! Vielen Dank!\n\nMaybe you overlooked my comment here which provides an idea of how many Germans invest in stocks at all. The report I linked includes even more profound data on different age groups and how exactly they have grown over the last year. Nevertheless common sense should still be applied after all, as you rightfully pointed out that the sampling itself and how people select questionnaire items is out of control and strongly biased.\n\nYears ago I was registered with some online market research platform and received surveys on a regular basis, with incentives ranging from ‚Ç¨0.50 to ‚Ç¨8.00. As the first question was usually a binary door opener (‚ÄúDo you currently have a Magenta mobile phone contract with T-Mobile?‚Äú) I knew exactly what to click in order to not be tossed out, complete the questionnaire,  and get the incentive. Most of the time I would go on just randomly clicking answers in order to not be excluded from future surveys. Based on this experience I know how biased and skewed online-surveying can be.\n\nI suppose that surveys that are implemented in an advertisement style in ad-funded website environments completely intransparent to the researcher have a very limited validity. Single question surveys in particular offer no analytical leeway to detect how logically coherent a participants answers are and statistically clean the data with regard to nonsense input.\n\nI appreciate your work and hope you‚Äôll consider these insights and my calculation provided above for your evaluation of the study‚Äôs limitations. Thanks for reading! üëçüèª', ""At this point I'm not even concerned about how many times retail owns the float. \n\nWhat is on everyone's mind and as time passes, something no one can know, is when...when will it pop? Seems they can commit crime so far without impunity, regardless of all the regulations that have recently come to pass (and that had us hyped so much).\n\nThe other pressing concern is of course...man there will be competition soon to grab the best deals on good properties and nice cars üòÇ that have not been scarce before the pop.\n\nYears ago hundreds and tens of thousands of people became buttcoin millionaires. It's time again, but this time the investors are (hopefully) a lot more conscious of the global fuckery afoot and will also do some good with their share of the monies to improve this planet and the lives of the everyday people.\n\nEdit: and hopefully there will be enough noise made to ensure that such high stake crimes are not committed on such a wide scale again by snakes like Ken and Co."", 'I should buy a float', "">5.1% of all Germans are currently stockholders\n\nThere is literally no way that is true.

The report I linked includes even more profound data on different age groups and how exactly they have grown over the last year. Nevertheless common sense should still be applied after all, as you rightfully pointed out that the sampling itself and how people select questionnaire items is out of control and strongly biased.\n\nYears ago I was registered with some online market research platform and received surveys on a regular basis, with incentives ranging from ‚Ç¨0.50 to ‚Ç¨8.00. As the first question was usually a binary door opener (‚ÄúDo you currently have a Magenta mobile phone contract with T-Mobile?‚Äú) I knew exactly what to click in order to not be tossed out, complete the questionnaire,  and get the incentive. Most of the time I would go on just randomly clicking answers in order to not be excluded from future surveys. Based on this experience I know how biased and skewed online-surveying can be.\n\nI suppose that surveys that are implemented in an advertisement style in ad-funded website environments completely intransparent to the researcher have a very limited validity. Single question surveys in particular offer no analytical leeway to detect how logically coherent a participants answers are and statistically clean the data with regard to nonsense input.\n\nI appreciate your work and hope you‚Äôll consider these insights and my calculation provided above for your evaluation of the study‚Äôs limitations.

I have no idea how high it will go but when this thing blows it will fly past $500 and not stop until someone somewhere can honestly say.. order has been restored to the markets and our faith and trust has been secured.  Edit: that s my opinion .. not financial advice.  Just a smooth brained opinion based upon individual observation. Ps: this stock would hit 500$ on fundamentals alone if they would stop manipulating the price through dark pools.  It is probably legit worth 600$ a share had all the buying pressure of us dumb apes been permitted to register on the open market', 'I\'ve been a supporter of better DD and critical thinking which is why I\'ve supported this thread despite it being VERY unpopular in the GME community.  How the hell is this not FUD?  $10 million is of course ridiculous but a ""DD"" saying essentially: ""You should sell at $500 cuz they will probably do bad stuff cuz that\'s what they did last time"" isn\'t DD or life-coaching advice; it\'s really suspicious.  I understand there are some considerations but I don\'t expect shenanigans until the 4 digits or 5 and the magnitude of the fallout of this works both ways.  The market is already being manipulated and losing confidence internationally -- crazy government interference will make that much worse.  There seems to be little discussion or research here beyond ""you should sell and have low expectations""...kinda like...ya know...Cramer.', 'Let me give you my side of why this will hit $1000+.\n\n1. The stock price hit over $520 in pre-market on Thursday, January 28th, prompting the buying restriction by Robinhood and others, sparking a congressional hearing.\n\n2. Capitol Hill had just been raided by 10,000 (?) fanatics who idolized a man. Do you thinking allowing millions of people to be robbed is smart for our congress? I wouldn‚Äôt want to see the fall out of this if the government steps in and fucks over retail.\n\n3. This is a global phenomenon. Trust in the U.S. markets is necessary for the U.S. to maintain status quo and also have the dollar be the worlds reserve currency.\n\n4. Between the SECs closed door meetings, whistleblower awards, and the new rules being pumped out by the DTCC,NSCC, and OCC, it is quite clear they are getting ready to manage a huge event. Factor in all the bonds the banks have recently sold to raise capital.... yeah, shits about to go down.\n\nJust my 2c on why they will let this happen, and have already been preparing to manage the fallout. I personally don‚Äôt believe the price will get to $10,000,000 because I don‚Äôt think people will have the intestinal fortitude to see it pass 100k, let alone 1mil. However I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see it go 10k+.\n\nWith that being said, no one knows the true SI except those that are shorting it, and maybe the DTCC/NSCC. No one can predict any ceiling price without that.', "" *. I think $500 may be the top.*   \n\n\n *while small fry are holding the bag.*   \n\n\n *Don‚Äôt let life changing money slip through your fingers.*  \n\n\nThese statements are a) emotive, b) mutually incompatible. If you're small fry, then $500 or even $5000 is not life changing money. Those are my clues you are not legitimately raising a concern.  \n\n\n**Counter-speculation:** There will be a divestment of capital from the US markets if there is true interference, and this divestment of capital will cause a deleveraging that DWARFS anything a payout for a well-contained (that's what DTCC and SEC have been doing last few months) squeeze will be.   \n\n\nHold for life-changing money, or wait for the e-commerce pivot to 4x your investment - those are the best strategies."", '""Dont let life changing money slip through your fingers""\n\n500/share is not life changing money', '$500 was one market maker fucking around and had an outsized impact because must people were on small exchanges.  Not ""them all"" conspiring.  \n\nThe big boys like vanguard and fidelity didn\'t halt at all and most apes have moved onto to them for that exact reason.  \n\nYes, the banks will collude to protect the system, but they will also cut each other down for profit if the system is not at risk.  The new DTCC rules are exactly there to protect the system and thus citadel and the shorts will get fucked proper.  \n\nThe govt also is for stability and profit, so same as above, if the system is protected, they\'ll let it run.  Maybe cap a price when the HFs run out of assets.  \n\nRyan cohen going to jail is just laughable.  He\'s a current billionaire and Epstein and Madoff are famous because they are the exception as rich people who actually went to jail.  \n\nYour post is just half assed ignorance at best and douchebag FUD at worst.

This whole situation has a broad global audience, and the US economy has already lost a lot of credibility over the past decade. If the apes are right, but still lose due to market manipulation and rule changes, it will be a giant nail in the coffin for our country on the world‚Äôs stage. To each their own. Sell out at $500 if that changes your life for the better. But for most small time non-yolo investors, that‚Äôs not even enough to make an extra month‚Äôs rent.

So somebody has to hold 100% of the float.  If the stock was at 10k, who would willingly choose to hold the float? All the shorts could cover but then who would buy at 10k?\n\nI feel like a lot of these PTs are designed to sell people in the same way that casinos and lotteries sell people -- maybe one person gets 1M, but not everyone can.', 'Doge was halted? How/by whom/for how long?', 'Finally a more realistic post. Tired of seeing $10mill floor. I will likely start my selling at $500 at least until I get my money back and then some.

When world was in chaos, the big banks gobbled up smaller ones. The only time Fed came to rescue was when banks demanded money ***for them***. \n\nThe big backers at GME, Blackrock and Vanguard are waiting to horde up on cheap assets when there is turmoil in the market. There will be many willing to take place of Shitadel and profit even if PFOF get regulated. MSM will be in full swing to supress any GME news at the time, and focus market crash on Fed injection of money.\n\nYou are only looking at this from GME shareholder point of view, the big banks have bigger plans when things shake down.', 'So, basically it may not go too high because cheating. Did that need a full post? How is that DD? What the f**k is this doing in the sub that\'s supposed to be about ""quality""?\n\nAlso, this IS FUD, whether you label it as that or not.

Seemed suspicious to me but it‚Äôs hard to say for sure. Also it wouldn‚Äôt really hurt them going from $0.0001 to $0.001 anyway, since they shorted when it was MUCH higher I‚Äôm betting.

On the other side is a collection of the richest and most unscrupulous people on the planet defending the only things they actually care about - their money, power and status.\r  \n\r\n\n**But not a single mention how bot past earnings reports two trillions was withdrawn from the crypto market to attack the price, which bounced back in a single day?**\n\n\\-\n\n**Citadel has over a dozen psych PhP on staff and the most successful psychops FUD campaigns occur where you don't even realize what you read as positive or affirming info is actual embedded within it with just a glance you come away uneasy for a second and start to question whether you want to continue playing this game for another 8 months - because an anonymous internet poster said something that appears good at first but is the lowkey equivalent to Custard's Last Stand speech before riding into battle.**\n\nAll I'm saying is that maybe be careful of what you read and look for new info, not regurgitated combined info posts leaving out key details while not giving any sources cited for anything new they're putting forward as DD.\n\nBe smart and read DD showing how we can actively fight and bring more manpower\n\n**All I hear is Buy & HODL, forget the rest - when we wouldn't have this war without the OG sub doubling from 4 to 7mil subscriber count in less than two weeks because we bought and hold but now anytime people mentioned pushing out digestible DD to their other social platforms its shut down and attacks faster that throwing a rock a hornets nest.**\n\nThere really needs to be a solid 4-5 page DD on GME for the average 25-65 potential investor post to be shared with your LinkedIn and FB connects & friends to show them why a stock that gained over 2k% in price in 12 months looks like a roller coaster. People deserve to know how to screw over hedgies and win with more numbers of apes to play this CDS game against them (what GME has finally come too or what we're called zombie baskets instead of the same same instrument responsible for the Jenga tower falling in 08'"", 'One thing I‚Äôve considered and been a little concerned about with the zombie stock price movements is that it could be a distraction to try and get apes to throw spare change in it if they can. From what I remember, the spikes only took a couple million worth, and it could have just as easily been Citadel and friends trading back and forth to give the illusion of activity without anything really happening. Then they could have paid people to post about how ‚ÄúI just bought a hundred worth of sears for the memes‚Äù and try and trick other people to do the same. Though I also remember reading some posts about how retail was supposedly blocked from buying those stocks. But then where did the people saying they bought some get them? Seemed suspicious to me but it‚Äôs hard to say for sure. Also it wouldn‚Äôt really hurt them going from $0.0001 to $0.001 anyway, since they shorted when it was MUCH higher I‚Äôm betting. If they have billions in unrealized profits from shorting a zombie stock, increasing the price by a teeny amount like that should only cost them a few million, if that, which would be insignificant in terms of managing their margin requirements IMO. Just another possibility to consider.', ""Anyone read the new glass ceiling DD on superstonk a couple days ago?

244,2009,2009,"[""Attrition is the word you are looking for... but it comes with patience...\n\nIt does cost them money to keep kicking the can, and you better believe they are doing everything they can to squeeze more assets and profit out of the system to cover that cost. Did anyone think they were just going to roll over and let it happen. Think of it as an offset, but with an ever increasing cost of doing business. As long as they can find the money, there is nothing to prevent them from continuing this behavior.\n\nThat being said, in a contrarian system, they are up against an ever increasing cost.  As the price floor rises on the stock (either due to people holding because they like the stock and or naturally due to the transformation of the company) the ability to kick the can gets more expensive. Eventually, and we don't know when, their ability to keep the price below a threshold level will fail, that will be the first margin call. \n\nThat itself does not mean a squeeze. They can pay that, show collateral, find other assets at that time, that does not mean it goes nuts. It only will end up parabolic when the short positions have to close their positions, that will be the demand on a lack of supply that I don't think this market has ever seen. \n\nThe sentiment you're feeling (and I am sure everyone who has delved into the fundamentals of this investment has felt as well) is tough. It is hard to stand up for what you know is right in the face of gas lighting and trickery. Attrition is a long game, and luckily for investors who believe in companies, they are in the long position. As far as I am concerned, I am in it to win it with GME, the downside risk against this company's future is low, and the upside potential of the company on its own is high. \n\nTo add to that, when a squeeze happens coincidentally because some really wealthy people risked the entire market so they could commit financial crimes to line their pockets due to the belief that they control the world, that is just icing on the cake for average Joes like us (no offense meant if you are above-average ;)) \n\nThis is not financial advice, just one ape trying to reconcile the question above with his glass smooth brain."", ""Kicking the can on GME isn't enough.

They can't even drop it to $150 now. \n\nThem dropping the price to $38 in Feb was their last shot at getting out of this. The fact that it went to $180 proved that they are incapable of winning.\n\nAlso all the bots, shills, MSM, etc also shows they NEED to try to convivence the public.\n\nIf they had the power, the price would be in the single digits and go into bankruptcy right now and they would be living high on tax free $billions in puts and they wouldn't need MSM to tell you not to invest in GME."", 'Think of kicking the can as inflating a balloon.

Did anyone think they were just going to roll over and let it happen. Think of it as an offset, but with an ever increasing cost of doing business. As long as they can find the money, there is nothing to prevent them from continuing this behavior.\n\nThat being said, in a contrarian system, they are up against an ever increasing cost.  As the price floor rises on the stock (either due to people holding because they like the stock and or naturally due to the transformation of the company) the ability to kick the can gets more expensive. Eventually, and we don't know when, their ability to keep the price below a threshold level will fail, that will be the first margin call. \n\nThat itself does not mean a squeeze. They can pay that, show collateral, find other assets at that time, that does not mean it goes nuts. It only will end up parabolic when the short positions have to close their positions, that will be the demand on a lack of supply that I don't think this market has ever seen. \n\nThe sentiment you're feeling (and I am sure everyone who has delved into the fundamentals of this investment has felt as well) is tough. It is hard to stand up for what you know is right in the face of gas lighting and trickery. Attrition is a long game, and luckily for investors who believe in companies, they are in the long position. As far as I am concerned, I am in it to win it with GME, the downside risk against this company's future is low, and the upside potential of the company on its own is high. \n\nTo add to that, when a squeeze happens coincidentally because some really wealthy people risked the entire market so they could commit financial crimes to line their pockets due to the belief that they control the world, that is just icing on the cake for average Joes like us (no offense meant if you are above-average ;)) \n\nThis is not financial advice, just one ape trying to reconcile the question above with his glass smooth brain."", ""Kicking the can on GME isn't enough.

I think real progress is possible on that front, but it will be incremental. As far as I can tell, the only way out of this is to build a society that values evidence-based accountability. To that end, we need to get people to understand the value of humility *and to reward leaders for it*.\n\nIf you look at political arguments, they\'re filled with conjecture and opinion. There\'s a place for that, but opinion can\'t be held at the same level as verifiable fact.\n\n""My tax plan will result in economic growth!"" Fine to say, but we need people to care enough to circle back and verify. Did it result in economic growth? If not, can that same leader *clearly explain what they got wrong and how to fix it*? Nobody is perfect, so even if the opposition messed up the plan a leader needs to be ready, willing, and able to talk about *the parts of that failure that they share responsibility in*. Owning up to mistakes should be rewarded, pawning off mistakes should be punished.\n\nRight now we\'re miles down a different path. People don\'t want humble leaders who work together, they want leaders that double down in the face of opposition in order to get their own way. That\'s expanded to the point where people don\'t even want there to be any attempt to gather evidence that might be used to hold their leaders accountable.\n\nPeople refused to get tested for COVID because they didn\'t want to get a positive test & ""give the other side ammunition"". People applauded efforts by leaders to literally ignore and suppress known information that contradicts the party line. \n\nThat\'s not to say that every ""investigation"" is legitimate. Once Congress has already, very publicly held 5 independent investigations into an opponent\'s handling of some event, holding a 6th, 7th, 8th... all without any new information being presented or discovered, that should be punished. Why? Because either the leaders championing these investigations are so inept that they can\'t even *hire* someone who isn\'t inept, *or* they are just using an ""investigation"" as political theater **which undermines the basic idea that truth is valuable and can be discovered**. \n\nThis is similar to the big tobacco playbook that pushed the idea that the ""science isn\'t settled"" on the health impacts of smoking. The point isn\'t to convince people that the science supports your side, because it very clearly doesn\'t. The point is to confuse people & to make them think that the scientific community is confused / unreliable on the issue. Suddenly, the power of objective truth is gone - any person who devoted their life to learning about this topic has suddenly been cast as no more reliable on the topic than your political leader of choice. If nobody is an expert worth listening to then you\'re just going to believe whoever wins you over - usually the person you already agreed with on other issues anyway.\n\nBasically, we need people to value leaders who don\'t just say, ""I\'m right. Follow me."" We need people to value leaders who say, ""I think this is right, but if it isn\'t then we will adapt as the evidence changes.""', 'Sounds like you want to change human nature.

I think real progress is possible on that front, but it will be incremental. As far as I can tell, the only way out of this is to build a society that values evidence-based accountability. To that end, we need to get people to understand the value of humility *and to reward leaders for it*.\n\nIf you look at political arguments, they\'re filled with conjecture and opinion. There\'s a place for that, but opinion can\'t be held at the same level as verifiable fact.\n\n""My tax plan will result in economic growth!"" Fine to say, but we need people to care enough to circle back and verify. Did it result in economic growth? If not, can that same leader *clearly explain what they got wrong and how to fix it*? Nobody is perfect, so even if the opposition messed up the plan a leader needs to be ready, willing, and able to talk about *the parts of that failure that they share responsibility in*. Owning up to mistakes should be rewarded, pawning off mistakes should be punished.\n\nRight now we\'re miles down a different path. People don\'t want humble leaders who work together, they want leaders that double down in the face of opposition in order to get their own way. That\'s expanded to the point where people don\'t even want there to be any attempt to gather evidence that might be used to hold their leaders accountable.\n\nPeople refused to get tested for COVID because they didn\'t want to get a positive test & ""give the other side ammunition"". People applauded efforts by leaders to literally ignore and suppress known information that contradicts the party line. \n\nThat\'s not to say that every ""investigation"" is legitimate. Once Congress has already, very publicly held 5 independent investigations into an opponent\'s handling of some event, holding a 6th, 7th, 8th... all without any new information being presented or discovered, that should be punished. Why? Because either the leaders championing these investigations are so inept that they can\'t even *hire* someone who isn\'t inept, *or* they are just using an ""investigation"" as political theater **which undermines the basic idea that truth is valuable and can be discovered**. \n\nThis is similar to the big tobacco playbook that pushed the idea that the ""science isn\'t settled"" on the health impacts of smoking. The point isn\'t to convince people that the science supports your side, because it very clearly doesn\'t. The point is to confuse people & to make them think that the scientific community is confused / unreliable on the issue. Suddenly, the power of objective truth is gone - any person who devoted their life to learning about this topic has suddenly been cast as no more reliable on the topic than your political leader of choice. If nobody is an expert worth listening to then you\'re just going to believe whoever wins you over - usually the person you already agreed with on other issues anyway.\n\nBasically, we need people to value leaders who don\'t just say, ""I\'m right. Follow me."" We need people to value leaders who say, ""I think this is right, but if it isn\'t then we will adapt as the evidence changes.""', 'Sounds like you want to change human nature.

But does that matter? There‚Äôs really no indication that he has even looked into all the DD about naked shorting and the total return swaps and all of that.

He didn't prematurely close his 2008 bets, he won't do it with GME if he didn't want to.\n\n>He sold it to show that any short squeeze would happen without him. \n\nWhat's the point?\n\n>The nation wont get vaccinated, much less agree that it's safe.\n\nMore than 50% are vaccinated.

You may continue to hold them, but you may have difficulty selling them in the future and there is no guarantee as to what their future value will be.\n\nPlace trades to liquidate. You may place trades to liquidate these securities now. Due to the uncertainly, we cannot guarantee there will be sufficient liquidity to close your position(s) in the future. \n\nTransfer your positions to another financial institution. Other U.S. financial institutions are also impacted by this amendment so you may have difficulty transferring them out of TD Ameritrade.

These amendments restrict the ability of market makers to publish quotations for those companies that have not made required current financial and company information available to regulators and investors.\n\nAhead of the regulatory enforcement date, we will only accept orders to liquidate positions (i.e. no new buy orders) starting August 13, 2021. After the amendment officially goes into effect on September 28, 2021, it may be more difficult to liquidate these securities. Quoting and market liquidity may also be very limited.  \n\nWhat this means for your account(s).\n\nYou are receiving this notification because you currently hold one or more of the impacted securities in your account. We're including the list below but be aware that it may not include all of your impacted securities. There is also a chance that the impacted companies could come into compliance with the regulatory requirements ahead of this date and be removed from the list.

You are not required to sell these securities; however, starting August 13, 2021 we will restrict these securities to liquidation-only transactions. You may continue to hold them, but you may have difficulty selling them in the future and there is no guarantee as to what their future value will be.\n\nPlace trades to liquidate. You may place trades to liquidate these securities now. Due to the uncertainly, we cannot guarantee there will be sufficient liquidity to close your position(s) in the future. \n\nTransfer your positions to another financial institution. Other U.S. financial institutions are also impacted by this amendment so you may have difficulty transferring them out of TD Ameritrade. If you are interested in transferring the assets, please submit any outgoing transfers requests to us. (These transactions may incur fees or commissions, depending on the asset type.)\n\nHave Questions? Need Any Help?\n\nWe're here for you.

There would be no fee on those as they aren't borrowed."", 'The discussion I\'ve read (if my memory serves correctly) has said a few things\n\n1.) Shares are hard to locate, and therefore hard to borrow. Very few shares are available for shorting.\n\n2.) Even though there are very few shorts, the demand for new shorts is very low. Therefore, the interest rates are competitive because nobody is trying to access what\'s left. Nobody ""wants"" to short gamestop.\n\nNow the above on its own sounds very FUDDY, and it is if you don\'t have the full picture. We already know FINRA messed with the calculations back in the past, and we know it\'s heavily overshorted. One reason the interest rate is low but the borrow rate is high might be that there might be a ton of shares shorted, but no more are being borrowed. Speculation suggests that the interest rate isn\'t there to punish old investors, its to attract new ones.

318,2234,2234,"['Hi OP! As we briefly discussed in our outreach, this post presents quite a unique circumstance in that through its crossposting to other $GME subs it has become far more visible than any other to come out of our small well-reasoned research, discussion, and peer review focused $GME community. Through this, a lot of the usual measured tone and freeflowing discussion/competition of ideas has been lost in the flood of participation.  OP has responded to moderation outreach in an exemplary manner, and I am extremely grateful, by agreeing to (as soon as he has time to amid irl concerns) edit in some of what he believes are the best counterpoint and constructive feedback comments to his speculative thesis + his responses to them so as to better indicate the tone of our sub to those unfamiliar with it.\n\nPersonally, I would also like to point out that 58x the float would not be 58x75M shares, but whatever the freely tradable float of gme is (changes over time) in the range of time you are describing. You may want to adjust your math accordingly or give an acknowledgement of its reductive qualities. Thank you again OP! \n\nAnd to any who wish to participate on this sub please keep in mind its focus. Good constructive critique of any thesis, that the thesis evolves in response to and/or withstands, *makes that thesis better*. The moderation team on this sub seeks to promote a culture in which we curate reasonable discussion and *welcome civil and constructive critique of our asserted theses*, as it is in the best interest of everyone to have the most exhaustively vetted information. Thank you all for understanding, and even if it is just a brief sojourn on our small sub, welcome to anyone new! We are building some infrastructure to automate our subs focus on this sort of constructive peer review in the near future!', 'Noticed how it all just went away‚Ä¶good reminder.', '‚ôæ or üí•', 'Hi peeps. u/delta_squeeze has written a passionate piece here. Please be aware of the toxicity rule on the sub when writing comments.\n\nCheers and have a good one.', ""Smooth brain here, so please take my intepretation with a grain of salt.\n\nI think the perceived ‚Äú'low' SI anchoring‚Äù has to do with the massive attention that Criand‚Äôs posts received recently, where he layed out an evidence-based theory on exactly how the original FINRA-reported 226% SI, which was suddenly lowered to ~30%, matches almost exactly with the amount of fake shares represented by the options (ITM puts) fuckery (where the Brazilian filings seem to have been the missing piece of the puzzle).    \nSome apes probably do not understand that the 226% range represents only the bare minimum SI.\n\nAs for me, I still believe that they underreport shorts and the real SI, taking naked shorts into account, is much higher than 226%. However, both a high and a low xxx% SI are unprecedented and would offer fantastic conditions for an infinity squeeze, so the real SI does not matter to me above a certain threshold.\n\nI also don‚Äôt believe there is a FUD campaign regarding SI. Let me get this straight: If shills were making efforts to lower the consensus on the estimated SI, they would go way lower and only refer to the current official numbers. SI anchoring at 3 digits as a FUD strategy just doesn‚Äôt make any sense in my opinion.\n\nSHF dug their hole too deep and at some point, they would never be able to make it out there alive. So does it even matter if they dug 226ft or 420ft or 1386ft deep? Should it have an impact on my strategy? Not really. Who cares about the actual SI when retail owns (x times) the float? üôÉ    \nThey have been shorting the shit out of GME, digging their hole deeper and deeper, because they see massive price dumps through dilution as their only way out and that is getting increasingly ineffective.\n\nEnjoy the dip. The floor is getting near $40M. Apes ain't fucking leaving. Meanwhile, RC and his crew are only getting started but the pace at which they transform the company is already mind-blowing by corporate world standards.\n\nüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\n(Please excuse any weird language or grammar. EN is not my native language.)"", ""Of course SI has to be higher. Apes keep buying more and more and price doesn't move. For every buy there has to be an equal and opposite sell. Third law of stonkodynamics."", 'Think about how many millions of dollars they‚Äôve spent on FUD campaigns alone. Off the top of my head here‚Äôs some of their most prominent examples:\n\n1.) SuperStonks getting all top leadership completely wiped out due to internal drama that was set off by a literal BlackWater merc who was anti-GME in November and was saying MOASS was a myth. Around the time she was made a mod Satori was introduced (software developed by Citadel) with many redditors losing Karma and unable to post.\n\nThis sub brought the top industry professionals together to give comprehensive breakdowns of why & how GME was happening and that MOASS was inevitable. A finance PhD college professor, 100+ award winning journalist, a 40+ anti financial criminal attorney specializing in shorting and an ex-Citadel employee that testified before Congress multiple times on WS regulation.\n\nThe sub also had a new daily thread format introduced that would crash for 5-15mins at a time multi times per day just so we could read through past daily threads? And then autobanning words without any mentioned or relation that would cause moral loss when people wrote out comments that were just removed with a snap even if their points were based on those banned words.\n\n\n2.) over a 13,000 results in 6 months that are for exact search phrase match ‚Äúforget GameStop‚Äù and that‚Äôs removing Reddit from the search parameters. Don‚Äôt forget the MarketWatch article posting about the drop 15mins before it occurred. There‚Äôs the 2009 video of Cramer bragging he could call up his journalist buddies with a FUD headline if he wanted to short a stock thinking the internet would never be as popular as TV (he‚Äôs like an anti fortune telling crystal ball)\n\n3.) WSB was received 4m new subs within a month after the first sneeze of GameStop. And then it‚Äôs suddenly banned from being mentioned. I spoke to a SS mod about an autobanned word and he replied that it wasn‚Äôt in their code and was being applied directly by Reddit with no replies from the admins on why. \n\nReddit has been making a lot of money under the table removing negative coverage of companies from its site for over a decade when leaked emails showed Sears was pressuring them 2009 to handle the growing ‚Äúfuck Sears‚Äù trend building on the site. There‚Äôs an Insider article detailing that saga, but it shows they‚Äôll bow to anyone with enough pressure. Imagine what a trillion dollar company can push vs a billion dollar one like Sears for God‚Äôs sake\n\n\n4.) FUD & shills. January saw the largest spike ever in the search term ‚Äúhow to buy a Reddit account‚Äù and multiple prominent users have been DM‚Äôd about being paid to post content as influencers. Same goes for Twitter where one users flat out said she was getting a few hundred per post but gave up.\n\nIf you look at New on any of the 4 main subs good DD posts get downvoted below zero in under a minute or filled with discrediting comments, saying the post is lying even when the source is quoted or giving logical fallacy arguments to discredit the main point of the post. Most good DD that makes it past the downvote army is quickly filled with comments that add no meaning discussion, just disguised FUD like implying that MOASS will go on forever because these SHF‚Äôs have as much money as they need\n\n5.) Reddit‚Äôs API has changed and now GME related subs are no longer appearing on Reddit sub tracking websites where they show biggest subs, fastest growing by day/week/month which circles back to point 3\n\n\n6.) Enormous backlash from shill accounts when professionals in the finance industry started speaking out on LinkedIn and people were suggesting we begin posting the best DD or reposting Mo or Jon‚Äôs posts with every reason under the sun from it‚Äôs a loser site that no one goes on to you‚Äôll lose your job to its unprofessional and will affect your career having your name attached to this?\n\nThis is what really triggered my spider monkey senses. There‚Äôs hundreds of millions of white class people on this site who have may only heard negative things about GME from MSM. A majority of them are educated, have a lot of disposable income after a year and a half of lockdown from not going anywhere in addition to salaried jobs.\n\nTrue GME info going viral through LinkedIn would trigger a huge pressure against SHF‚Äôs. The only reason MOASS became a reality was the information wasn‚Äôt contained fast enough and millions of Redditors bought in to become diamond hands. There was so much buy pressure they had to delete the buy button.\n\nA lot of them were younger and spent their meager savings and stimulus money. That‚Äôs the strength in numbers. Imagine a few thousand bored millionaires and many more Gen Z and boomers that remember 08‚Äô with hate and want to stick it to Wall Street.\n\nI firmly believe the majority of price action in GME has been from FTD cycles where SHF‚Äôs freaked out, shorted the stock when it rose to margin call territory and then kept having to launder their FTD‚Äôs through other brokerages in addition to dark pool buy order routing and live market sell routing while diamond hands put in paychecks every week.\n\n\n7.) divide and conquer. Pulling from some above statements as well, we went from a 7mil subscriber sub with 3 100k GME threads daily to a 300k sub and now 4 main ones with SS barely tickling 600k and the two main are compromised to all hell. The less we boosted each other up the less the community interacted and went back into the same buy & HODL mantra. Remember when we were renting billboards and airplanes?? I loved the rocket & diamond emojis, the positivity and discussion, the theories and apes commenting piece A, another piece B until to Z where it was made into a fully sourced DD post.\n\nThis is just my insomniatic mind getting my observations from the past 6 months out, but we gotta do more than just DD and wait. There needs to be a push towards contacting legislators, posting on every social media platform to spread the word (another thing I think shills are doing by saying keep quiet, you don‚Äôt want people knowing you‚Äôre rich after MOASS) and talking to your friends and neighbors. Be a missionary of GME, spread the word of DeepFuckingValue, hell print bumper stickers and hand out pamphlets in NYC or big cities across the globe. We got Ants, Euros, Apes. Bring power with numbers and info.', 'I thought the daily short volume,was the equivalent of the buy pressure waiting to be honored by MM, can a brain confirm?', ""I was predicting up to 500% back in march. No idea where it is now (was using estimations of reddit retail ownerships before, and it's become increasingly hard to get a meaningful estimate of average buy-ins since due to less talk on it) but it's definitely not lower. Could be 1000% fairly easily, would hazard a guess at about 800% though because anything lower than 600% seems improbable, and over 1200% also seems improbable with the desert volume we've had the last couple months. But honestly just haven't tried to update my SI estimates and peak estimate because I came to realize it's safe to say after 300% SI and with the information out there on GME, it's highly improbable that it won't hit at least 9 digits at peak. I just keep adjusting my price anchors based on talked about floors, my initial predictions, and infinity pool talk. \n\nAt this point price is whatever retail makes it. If people paperhand most of their shares in the 8 digits, it would probably peak mid 9 digits... maybe low 10. If people diamond hand 20% shares with a 500% SI it peaks when regulators make a rule change to end it or when the diamond hands finally sell. In my opinion it's less important to know SI right now (again little difference between 300% and 3000%) and more important to watch retail price sentiment and adjust upwards from the average price floor (for instance if I see a lot of people saying floor is 35M, then my floor is at least 300M. The 35M comon floor just tells me it will at least pass that price easily).\n\nNot financial advice, all aforementioned estimates were made and explained in a post way back (essentially just some rough math based on sub counts, talked about price floors, bell curves, etc gathered back at the time) and based on my trust in my own estimation skills I have honed over the years. Not really a technical analysis, just my opinion."", ""I remember a DD that speculated anywhere from 900% all the way to 2,651%.\n\n\nGood times. \n\n\nInfinity pool destroys them even harder because whatever goes into the infinity pool is effectively removed from the float, so instead of having to cover 14x the float, they end up having to do 18x or 21x the float. \n\n\nRemember when VW has a SI of 12.8% but the available float was 1%? That's what happens when enough people infinitypool it.\n\n\nThanks for the reminder and I think a more critical examination of total short is definitely needed. I was reasonably sure we owned the float since Feb, so there is not way we stayed at 200% 4 months down the road with all the incredible amounts of price suppression we've seen."", 'If no sell price go up until sell. \n\nüíéüôå', ""I actually couldn't agree more. There is no way that they could restrain themselves from going well beyond what would seem reasonable. ESPECIALLY after they nearly bought the farm in January. They have paid far more than the price of the stock per share to simply hold their existing position, so I also believe that their positions are so untenable that they can't begin to unravel it. Frankly speaking 200% SI seems to reasonable for habitual lawbreakers trying to sink a business, when they literally have no limit to how many rehypothecated shares they can produce.\n\nThink for a minute that they have never been punished in any real sense. Traditionally the law enforcement hasn't bothered them, and they have been massively successful doing this until now. To me all of those things tell me that these people would be massively overconfident. They had it down to $4 for the love of everything holy and they never exited.

However, both a high and a low xxx% SI are unprecedented and would offer fantastic conditions for an infinity squeeze, so the real SI does not matter to me above a certain threshold.\n\nI also don‚Äôt believe there is a FUD campaign regarding SI.

Same goes for Twitter where one users flat out said she was getting a few hundred per post but gave up.\n\nIf you look at New on any of the 4 main subs good DD posts get downvoted below zero in under a minute or filled with discrediting comments, saying the post is lying even when the source is quoted or giving logical fallacy arguments to discredit the main point of the post. Most good DD that makes it past the downvote army is quickly filled with comments that add no meaning discussion, just disguised FUD like implying that MOASS will go on forever because these SHF‚Äôs have as much money as they need\n\n5.) Reddit‚Äôs API has changed and now GME related subs are no longer appearing on Reddit sub tracking websites where they show biggest subs, fastest growing by day/week/month which circles back to point 3\n\n\n6.) Enormous backlash from shill accounts when professionals in the finance industry started speaking out on LinkedIn and people were suggesting we begin posting the best DD or reposting Mo or Jon‚Äôs posts with every reason under the sun from it‚Äôs a loser site that no one goes on to you‚Äôll lose your job to its unprofessional and will affect your career having your name attached to this?\n\nThis is what really triggered my spider monkey senses. There‚Äôs hundreds of millions of white class people on this site who have may only heard negative things about GME from MSM. A majority of them are educated, have a lot of disposable income after a year and a half of lockdown from not going anywhere in addition to salaried jobs.\n\nTrue GME info going viral through LinkedIn would trigger a huge pressure against SHF‚Äôs. The only reason MOASS became a reality was the information wasn‚Äôt contained fast enough and millions of Redditors bought in to become diamond hands. There was so much buy pressure they had to delete the buy button.\n\nA lot of them were younger and spent their meager savings and stimulus money. That‚Äôs the strength in numbers. Imagine a few thousand bored millionaires and many more Gen Z and boomers that remember 08‚Äô with hate and want to stick it to Wall Street.\n\nI firmly believe the majority of price action in GME has been from FTD cycles where SHF‚Äôs freaked out, shorted the stock when it rose to margin call territory and then kept having to launder their FTD‚Äôs through other brokerages in addition to dark pool buy order routing and live market sell routing while diamond hands put in paychecks every week.\n\n\n7.) divide and conquer. Pulling from some above statements as well, we went from a 7mil subscriber sub with 3 100k GME threads daily to a 300k sub and now 4 main ones with SS barely tickling 600k and the two main are compromised to all hell. The less we boosted each other up the less the community interacted and went back into the same buy & HODL mantra. Remember when we were renting billboards and airplanes?? I loved the rocket & diamond emojis, the positivity and discussion, the theories and apes commenting piece A, another piece B until to Z where it was made into a fully sourced DD post.\n\nThis is just my insomniatic mind getting my observations from the past 6 months out, but we gotta do more than just DD and wait. There needs to be a push towards contacting legislators, posting on every social media platform to spread the word (another thing I think shills are doing by saying keep quiet, you don‚Äôt want people knowing you‚Äôre rich after MOASS) and talking to your friends and neighbors. Be a missionary of GME, spread the word of DeepFuckingValue, hell print bumper stickers and hand out pamphlets in NYC or big cities across the globe. We got Ants, Euros, Apes. Bring power with numbers and info.', 'I thought the daily short volume,was the equivalent of the buy pressure waiting to be honored by MM, can a brain confirm?', ""I was predicting up to 500% back in march. No idea where it is now (was using estimations of reddit retail ownerships before, and it's become increasingly hard to get a meaningful estimate of average buy-ins since due to less talk on it) but it's definitely not lower. Could be 1000% fairly easily, would hazard a guess at about 800% though because anything lower than 600% seems improbable, and over 1200% also seems improbable with the desert volume we've had the last couple months. But honestly just haven't tried to update my SI estimates and peak estimate because I came to realize it's safe to say after 300% SI and with the information out there on GME, it's highly improbable that it won't hit at least 9 digits at peak. I just keep adjusting my price anchors based on talked about floors, my initial predictions, and infinity pool talk. \n\nAt this point price is whatever retail makes it. If people paperhand most of their shares in the 8 digits, it would probably peak mid 9 digits... maybe low 10. If people diamond hand 20% shares with a 500% SI it peaks when regulators make a rule change to end it or when the diamond hands finally sell. In my opinion it's less important to know SI right now (again little difference between 300% and 3000%) and more important to watch retail price sentiment and adjust upwards from the average price floor (for instance if I see a lot of people saying floor is 35M, then my floor is at least 300M. The 35M comon floor just tells me it will at least pass that price easily).\n\nNot financial advice, all aforementioned estimates were made and explained in a post way back (essentially just some rough math based on sub counts, talked about price floors, bell curves, etc gathered back at the time) and based on my trust in my own estimation skills I have honed over the years. Not really a technical analysis, just my opinion."", ""I remember a DD that speculated anywhere from 900% all the way to 2,651%.\n\n\nGood times. \n\n\nInfinity pool destroys them even harder because whatever goes into the infinity pool is effectively removed from the float, so instead of having to cover 14x the float, they end up having to do 18x or 21x the float. \n\n\nRemember when VW has a SI of 12.8% but the available float was 1%? That's what happens when enough people infinitypool it.\n\n\nThanks for the reminder and I think a more critical examination of total short is definitely needed. I was reasonably sure we owned the float since Feb, so there is not way we stayed at 200% 4 months down the road with all the incredible amounts of price suppression we've seen."", 'If no sell price go up until sell. \n\nüíéüôå', ""I actually couldn't agree more.

They have paid far more than the price of the stock per share to simply hold their existing position, so I also believe that their positions are so untenable that they can't begin to unravel it. Frankly speaking 200% SI seems to reasonable for habitual lawbreakers trying to sink a business, when they literally have no limit to how many rehypothecated shares they can produce.\n\nThink for a minute that they have never been punished in any real sense. Traditionally the law enforcement hasn't bothered them, and they have been massively successful doing this until now.

I‚Äôm sure you mean well, but I could also say you‚Äôre ingraining a false limit of 10% for the infinity pool. That number only makes sense if you have a well-build case of the real short interest.

I have joined online forums such as Reddit with subreddits (or ‚Äúthreads‚Äù) with over 1/2 a million members internationally whom openly discuss investing topics including the brokers and apps used to participate in financial markets. A lot of information is shared among 100‚Äôs of thousands of retailers in an information ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù that cannot be ignored and I have seen a lot of positive sentiment towards Wealth Trade Simple (WTS) for various reasons as your company has not acted against retailers interests by limiting buys like Robinhood and other apps in the US, or even limiting money amounts of ‚Äúlimit sells‚Äù. For your information screen shots of these interactions with WTS are also posted on these online forums and have been celebrated internationally which is incredible for WTS‚Äôs reputation and customer sentiment. I am writing to both confirm some of these topics and give my appreciation as a retailer and a customer of your services which gives me the confidence and gratitude that will assure my lifetime business with your services and has informed some of the most positive online reviews and continuous online posts I‚Äôve ever made elevating WTS‚Äôs integrity to 100‚Äôs of thousands, also resulting in myself personally being responsible for at least 6 other people I know opening accounts with your app. To my questions all concerning my TFSA with WTS: \n\nWTS‚Äôs Response:\n\nReally appreciate the kind words here, happy to answer these questions one-by-one below.\n\nQ: Can you confirm there are no amount limits to ‚Äúsell limits‚Äù?\n\nA: There are no theoretical dollar amount limits which can be sold on the platform. That being said, it is important to note that there is currently a digit limit of 6 digits (ex: 999,999) because no share trades beyond 6 digits at this time. In the event that a security trades above this limit, we would enable the entering of orders beyond this limit. We are also not restricting users from trading or selling their shares, other than in the event of a regulatory or exchange-level trading halt which we are legally obligated to abide by.\n\nQ: How much would my account be insured for? i.e. if I experienced a windfall of millions how much would be insured as I understand even bank accounts in Canada have limits to insurance on amounts held.\n\nA: Your assets are covered by CIPF (Canadian Investor Protection Fund) within specified limits. A brochure describing the nature and limits of coverage is available upon request or at www.cipf.ca. All of your assets are held with our brokerage, Canadian ShareOwner Investments, which is an IIROC Dealer Member and CIPF participant.\n\nIn the extremely unlikely event that Wealthsimple were to go out of business, your account would remain safe and be largely unaffected. All securities are registered in your name, and if we were to close, you could choose to keep your money with ShareOwner, or transfer it to a new advisor or your bank account.\n\nQ: How much can I transfer from my TFSA to my chequings account with a Canadian bank from WTS? \n\nA: There is no limit to how much you can transfer from your TFSA to your chequing account whatsoever, you are free to withdraw any amount at any time. There is a settlement period of 5 business days for new deposits before they can be withdrawn. In addition, funds generated from the selling of shares need to settle for 2 business days before they can be withdrawn.\n\nQ: Are there any limits on the amounts of monies entering my account from a stock sale from US markets?\n\nA: There is no limit on the amount of funds from the selling of a security.\n\nQ: Whom can I submit complaints to in Canada regarding illegal stock manipulation with my US investments?\n\nA: You can file a complaint with us here. Once you submit a complaint through there, our legal team can provide you with additional resources or guidance on what legal authority you can file a complaint to.\n\nQ: Can you please confirm that Payment for Order Flow is illegal in Canada and WTS does not practice this?\n\nA: Payment for order flow is not allowed in Canada and Wealthsimple does not practice this whatsoever.\n\nQ: Are there specific person within WTS I can submit my positive experiences to?\n\nA: Generally, after you have an interaction with an associate, you will receive a follow up survey which allows you to rate the interaction.

As the DD has now shown, locking up shares out of DTCC reach makes the liquidity pool smaller and smaller. It also eliminates the ability to do any shenanigans with calls and puts. \n\nSecond the dedicated believers in the potential of the stonk. There is a large pool of gme apes and we just keep buying, holding and DRS\'ing. \n\nLastly is the relatively small size of the shares outstanding and the float. It is simple math. The smaller the float size, the easier to buy up the float. \n\nPut all three together and you have MOASS material.\n\nNow back to popcorn.  They have started to DRS as well - albeit it has taken longer to catch on over there than it did here. So they are working towards my first point. More power to them to continue the trend. They also have a very dedicated group of apes that believe in the stock. So this gives them my second point. BUT the number of shares outstanding is HUGE (sorry guys, but in this case SIZE DOES MATTER). Popcorn apes will simply have a numerically harder time to buy up the float. This is why i believe popcorn will spike but not to MOASS levels. \n\nAnother side note to this is that there is another of the meme stock basket that has definite MOASS potential IF my three points can brought together there. It is the headphone stock. (K - O - S - S).  1) They are starting to get on board with DRS. 2) they currently do not have the same huge following as GME or popcorn. BUT 3) their total outstanding shares in only around 8 million versus GME at 70+ million and popcorns 500+ million. And their float is like only about 4.5 million. Straight math shows that it would not take much to buy up their float. PLUS, they do NOT have call or put options available.  No fuckery that way. \n\nPlus the price per share is small right now.

As the DD has now shown, locking up shares out of DTCC reach makes the liquidity pool smaller and smaller. It also eliminates the ability to do any shenanigans with calls and puts. \n\nSecond the dedicated believers in the potential of the stonk. There is a large pool of gme apes and we just keep buying, holding and DRS\'ing. \n\nLastly is the relatively small size of the shares outstanding and the float. It is simple math. The smaller the float size, the easier to buy up the float. \n\nPut all three together and you have MOASS material.\n\nNow back to popcorn.  They have started to DRS as well - albeit it has taken longer to catch on over there than it did here. So they are working towards my first point. More power to them to continue the trend. They also have a very dedicated group of apes that believe in the stock. So this gives them my second point. BUT the number of shares outstanding is HUGE (sorry guys, but in this case SIZE DOES MATTER). Popcorn apes will simply have a numerically harder time to buy up the float. This is why i believe popcorn will spike but not to MOASS levels. \n\nAnother side note to this is that there is another of the meme stock basket that has definite MOASS potential IF my three points can brought together there. It is the headphone stock. (K - O - S - S).  1) They are starting to get on board with DRS. 2) they currently do not have the same huge following as GME or popcorn. BUT 3) their total outstanding shares in only around 8 million versus GME at 70+ million and popcorns 500+ million. And their float is like only about 4.5 million. Straight math shows that it would not take much to buy up their float. PLUS, they do NOT have call or put options available.  No fuckery that way. \n\nPlus the price per share is small right now.

Indeed, review of the clearing firm list at [https://speedtrader.com/short-list/](https://speedtrader.com/short-list/) confirms GME shares are, unsurprisingly, not available for locates. So tell me, absent written consent to share lending or margin, how did my shares end up marked as a locate? Was this a glitch?\n\nAnswering this question requires resort to Fidelity\'s description of its trading strategies, and an understanding of the channels Fidelity accesses to trade against its net long customers.\n\nAs respects this issue, there are just a few finite possibilities:\n\n1. Fidelity marks securities as sold short without obtaining permission from the beneficial owners of the security. If, as my experience suggests, Fidelity is doing so here, they are violating Regulation SHO Rule 203, which, by way of exception, mandates a broker-dealer obtain *consent* from beneficial owners of all securities that, like GME, are hard-to-borrow. Thus, all such transgressions are actionable offenses or other wrongs that mandate reporting;\n2. Fidelity lends out shares from its own inventory, and trades against retail longs;\n3. Net long retail customers inadvertently allow Fidelity to sell their shares short by trading in margin accounts;\n4. Fidelity borrows inflow and shorts that inflow against retail longs.\n\nFortunately, there is no need to spill ink pondering which of these strategies Fidelity actually employs since, as it concedes in its official response pinned above, it pursues **all** of them:\n\n*Our shortable share quantity is a combination of internal supply* \\[possibility 2\\] *. . .  ""margin rehypothecation""* \\[possibility 3\\] *. . . \\[and\\]  feeds that our lending counterparties share with us* \\[possibility 4\\]*.*\n\nThese strategies not only raise unsettling questions about Fidelity\'s conduct as a fiduciary, but they further beg the question of whether and to what extent Fidelity is mainly responsible for controlling GME\'s price movement. After all, how could the interests of net long GME holders possibly be advanced while their holdings are overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a single broker-dealer who, as part of its confirmed trading strategy, receives inflow on its institutional side for the single purpose of shorting out its net long retail customers?\n\nHow does this practice not at best result in endless can kicking and, at worst, a prolonged squeeze on retail? How is this not an egregious conflict of interest?\n\n**Preliminary Conclusion**\n\nFidelity is, at least at this time, retail\'s counterparty. They are the hub.

Indeed, review of the clearing firm list at [https://speedtrader.com/short-list/](https://speedtrader.com/short-list/) confirms GME shares are, unsurprisingly, not available for locates. So tell me, absent written consent to share lending or margin, how did my shares end up marked as a locate? Was this a glitch?\n\nAnswering this question requires resort to Fidelity\'s description of its trading strategies, and an understanding of the channels Fidelity accesses to trade against its net long customers.\n\nAs respects this issue, there are just a few finite possibilities:\n\n1. Fidelity marks securities as sold short without obtaining permission from the beneficial owners of the security. If, as my experience suggests, Fidelity is doing so here, they are violating Regulation SHO Rule 203, which, by way of exception, mandates a broker-dealer obtain *consent* from beneficial owners of all securities that, like GME, are hard-to-borrow. Thus, all such transgressions are actionable offenses or other wrongs that mandate reporting;\n2. Fidelity lends out shares from its own inventory, and trades against retail longs;\n3. Net long retail customers inadvertently allow Fidelity to sell their shares short by trading in margin accounts;\n4. Fidelity borrows inflow and shorts that inflow against retail longs.\n\nFortunately, there is no need to spill ink pondering which of these strategies Fidelity actually employs since, as it concedes in its official response pinned above, it pursues **all** of them:\n\n*Our shortable share quantity is a combination of internal supply* \\[possibility 2\\] *. . .  ""margin rehypothecation""* \\[possibility 3\\] *. . . \\[and\\]  feeds that our lending counterparties share with us* \\[possibility 4\\]*.*\n\nThese strategies not only raise unsettling questions about Fidelity\'s conduct as a fiduciary, but they further beg the question of whether and to what extent Fidelity is mainly responsible for controlling GME\'s price movement. After all, how could the interests of net long GME holders possibly be advanced while their holdings are overwhelmingly concentrated in the hands of a single broker-dealer who, as part of its confirmed trading strategy, receives inflow on its institutional side for the single purpose of shorting out its net long retail customers?\n\nHow does this practice not at best result in endless can kicking and, at worst, a prolonged squeeze on retail? How is this not an egregious conflict of interest?\n\n**Preliminary Conclusion**\n\nFidelity is, at least at this time, retail\'s counterparty. They are the hub.

It is not all due once the forbearance ends in one lump payment. \n\n""How does a forbearance plan work on a mortgage?\nForbearance is when your mortgage servicer, that\'s the company that sends your mortgage statement and manages your loan, or lender allows you to pause or reduce your payments for a limited period of time. Forbearance does not erase what you owe. You\'ll have to repay any missed or reduced payments in the future."" \n\nI do not think all of a sudden people will all be booted out, could be lots of people who struggled and took advantage of delayed payments for whatever reason and when times comes to pay they will just continue on paying.

Options, used the right way, could be the match to light the fuse. \n\nIn my opinion this is solely with using in the money and deep in the money options in advance of a rollover, and use them to buy shares. \n\nI would imagine that if they survive this run, when the rollover period is about to start, buy an ITM call and exercise it to buy 100 shares. You can still exercise out of the money calls before they expire - if you really want to do that. But you can also contribute to gamma ramping by owning the call. The trick here is to get one that stays ITM. As expiration gets closer, OTM calls are unhedged, and ITM calls are hedged. So buying far OtM calls can drive down the price which is a good reason to stay away from those ($600+) and suggest others do as well. \n\nIt seems that they are strongly susceptible to the effects of options as we see such a controlled effort to drive the price down for option expiration. When a lot of options expire ITM, we a see a jump the following Tuesday. I believe this is a buy to close of the short position to deliver shares for the call which is sold naked.

If that happens, it will be a bright line for China and they will respond.\n\nSun Tzu says that when the economy gets rough, the military should become expeditionary. This is exactly what the Bush administration did after the Dot-Com Crash, causing the ""forever wars."" China has been building its expeditionary military might over the last 20 years. Right now, because of the popularity of the ""Wolf Warrior"" movie franchise, there\'s an aggressive -- borderline insubordinate -- subculture within the Chinese military. You can see this with the number of flights last month into Taiwan\'s Air-Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), just before Taiwan\'s independence day. The Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations took a more conciliatory tone with China, hoping to maintain an unstable friendship. From the start, the Biden administration has had a much harsher and more challenging tone with China. Macron might whine publicly about losing the nuke sub deal, and Biden might publicly backtrack and give France the deal, but regardless -- Australia is getting nuke subs to help defend Southeast Asia from Chinese aggression. There world did nothing about Hong Kong, and Taiwan is set to be the next test of Chinese containment.\n\nI expect either Chinese invasion of Taiwan or a ""false flag"" event by the US or allies. A critical event is needed to motivate Western countries, because their public support is low for war, which is one of Clausewitz\'s requirements for a nation going to war. A proxy conflict over Taiwan could be just the domestic distraction needed to keep Chinese unrest low, and it would justify additional government central-bank spending in the West as it did for WW1, WW2, and the past 20 years.\n\nI don\'t think war is off the table, but I also recognize this is probably a worst-case scenario.\n\nIt\'s fitting that the FATF just finished its recommendations for international management of cryptocurrencies. After the coming collapse, crypto has the potential to reduce the ""softy money"" inflation caused by central bank fiat regimes over the past century. By creating an international legal framework that punishes anonymous crypto trading and requires KYC and full market monitoring, they do well to ensure Dollar Dominance despite the weakness created by printing 20% of all dollars within the past two years.\n\nI don\'t think crypto collapse will be the catalyst. It might be the only hard money during the crash, much as it has been for South American and African countries during their hyperinflation periods over the past few years. I think central banks and GSIBS are committed to taking control of crypto before it threatens their hegemony.', ""My thoughts are that they already know it's going to crash. They just need some rather large news to pin the blame onto. My brain (smooth as it is) thinks China and the US are trying to blame each other, neither is letting go until the other visibly crumbles. Neither party wants to be seen as the cause.  \nI also suspect that behind the scenes a lot of untangling of certain derivatives has been going on. Trying to get all the bad risk into one large pile, rather than spread throughout the entire market. Isolate the risk, keep the crash from decimating everything and anything.  \n\n\nI did read somewhere in a DD that maybe Shitadel itself was being set up to take the fall. I like that idea.

By creating an international legal framework that punishes anonymous crypto trading and requires KYC and full market monitoring, they do well to ensure Dollar Dominance despite the weakness created by printing 20% of all dollars within the past two years.\n\nI don\'t think crypto collapse will be the catalyst. It might be the only hard money during the crash, much as it has been for South American and African countries during their hyperinflation periods over the past few years. I think central banks and GSIBS are committed to taking control of crypto before it threatens their hegemony.', ""My thoughts are that they already know it's going to crash. They just need some rather large news to pin the blame onto. My brain (smooth as it is) thinks China and the US are trying to blame each other, neither is letting go until the other visibly crumbles. Neither party wants to be seen as the cause.  \nI also suspect that behind the scenes a lot of untangling of certain derivatives has been going on. Trying to get all the bad risk into one large pile, rather than spread throughout the entire market. Isolate the risk, keep the crash from decimating everything and anything.  \n\n\nI did read somewhere in a DD that maybe Shitadel itself was being set up to take the fall. I like that idea. But for sure some comapny(ies?) are being lined up to be the fall guys taking the brunt of the pain into liquidation. It would make a lot of sense from a market perspective."", 'Hey OP, your word choices make you sound like a fellow scientist ape! ü§£üöÄ', 'It\'s amazing how Tether\'s scheme has been kept on walking far past the ledge with every stakeholder refusing to look down. I do not know if that particular game of musical chairs is the main event or a side show, a trigger or a contributing body blow to the finances of untold numbers of people and groups all over the world but... it\'s long since dwarfed Bernie Madoff.\n\nI don\'t know what exactly will losing that much money do to everything connected to it since it\'s ""already gone"" but anything pumped by and with it will be leaving a sizable hole in portfolios all over the place. Some of the quickest might reach an exit of sorts by selling their bags but those that built their fortunes on something *relying* on it in a foundational, systemic fashion won\'t have that option. It remains to be seen what can be salvaged from the wreckage...\n\nHowever, when the GME MOASS gets going it may lay bare an even bigger fraud, depending on whether all the naked shorts of just one, a few, or all the victim companies come to light in the aftermath. All this in the midst of a global supply chain arrhythmia... and increasing rate and severity of climate impacts on top of an on-going pandemic.

487,714,714,"[""Great work on your research and taking the time to write this all out! Appreciate the effort and level of detail. While I agree with the facts we have a slightly different view point on your speculation.\n\nThis topic isn‚Äôt specifically about GME, but it does come up a lot so it‚Äôs good we‚Äôre taking time to dive deeper.\n\nTo address the money supply increase in the economy it‚Äôs important to contrast with other countries to get a more objective view. We live in a global economy after all. :)\n\nLet‚Äôs use the M2 because it includes 100% of the M1 and the M2 is broad money supply. Broad money usually affects the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\n**M2 Money Supply Increase**\n\n2020 Jan - 2021 March\n\nUS - 29%\n\n[Canada](https://imgur.com/UqU4bpv) \\- 21%\n\n[Sweden](https://imgur.com/0ssbkLn) \\- 20%\n\n[France](https://imgur.com/pIkqBzh) \\- 19%\n\n[UK](https://imgur.com/67u6MuN) \\- 17%\n\n[Japan](https://imgur.com/eY1flEx) \\- 11%\n\n[Germany](https://imgur.com/9yk2KmH) \\- 11%\n\nThe US certainly printed more money than other countries, but I wonder if the FED printed enough relative to other countries to justify using the phrase ‚ÄòLosing faith in the dollar‚Äô because of the dollar devaluation.\n\nIf ONLY the US printed a ton of money then yes I would agree with you and the situation would be similar to Venezuela, but many central banks printed money during COVID.\n\n[Let‚Äôs take a look at the G4 central banks balance sheet.](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/peacockfedecbassets.pdf)\n\nFED (US) - 4.1T to 7.7T around a 88% increase\n\nECB (Europe) - 5T to 9.1T around a 82% increase\n\nBOJ (Japan) - 5.2T to 6.6T around a 27% increase\n\nPBOC (China) - 5.1T to 5.9T around a 16% increase\n\nSo what‚Äôs the alternative to the US dollar as the world's reserve currency?\n\nChinese yuan? EU Euro? Japanese Yen?\n\nThere isn‚Äôt a better alternative. I'll be happy to go more in detail why those 3 currencies aren't great alternatives. Just let me know :)\n\nThe real issue here isn't the dollar losing value but fiat currencies overall losing value. This is called fiat currency debasement. Perhaps Crypo will eventually be a better alternative, but this is a topic for a different time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Utilization of T-Bonds as Risk-Free collateral in the creation of synthetic equities\n\nThis is a smart conclusion, but unfortunately it doesn't quite fit for me to be convinced. :)\n\nIf I'm understanding this correctly a [synthetic stock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvO0RGsh688) requires the risk-free T-bond to offset the cost of carry(theta decay), but because the T-bonds from the reverse repos are only 1 day they probably won't receive the fixed interest. [Treasury bonds pay a fixed interest rate on a semi-annual basis.](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/how-often-do-treasury-bonds-pay-interest/) Let me know if I missed something here. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Satisfying settlements on outstanding T-Bond short positions\n\nThe highest price of 10 Year Treasury Futures was around 140 and the lowest was around 131. This is a 6.42% max profit if you perfectly timed the short.\n\nShorting T-bonds for profit doesn't really make sense here. Through a leveraged ETF like Burry? Sure, but not by shorting the T-bond itself.\n\nEspecially considering that the US dollar won't actually lose a ton of value vs the other fiat currencies. **They will all lose value.**\n\nShorting to hedge makes perfect sense when Japan was selling a ton of bonds. Many institutions had no idea what was happening and needed to hedge quickly. This led to a temporary storage of T-bonds from high demand and negative interest rates.\n\n[The FED confirmed this here.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20210428.htm)\n\n>the staff noted that such a facility could limit the propensity for foreign official institutions to execute large sales of U.S. Treasury securities in a stress environment that, in turn, could exacerbate strains in broader U.S. domestic financial markets\n\nIt's interesting because when the FED was buying a ton of T-bonds no one was questioning the motive. Everyone was like QE - yeah that makes perfect sense.\n\nNow that QE isn't required and there are inflation concerns the FED is doing the opposite, but now there is a conspiracy behind this? If anything the real conspiracy is fiat currency debasement rather than the FED dealing with inflation.\n\nI mean - inflation is a real concern and how else would the FED deal with it?\n\nGoing to change the flair to reviewed DD because there's a lot of great research in here even if not directly related to GME! Appreciate your effort, level of detail and objective point of view! :)\n\nEDIT: typos"", 'This is exactly my thought. Beutifully organised, u/leisure_rules!\n\nThis is the logical counter-measure I¬¥d do to fight against an uncontrolled inflation getting out of hands, imho.\n\nI do not think this is intrinsically GME-related though, just some collateral issue with SHFs', 'Great job, ape üöÄüíéü§ù', ""Part of the conclusion doesn't make sense to me. There is no way the government believes that this whole thing can be staved off forever by unlimited 'patchwork' when it comes to the collateral and equity crisis. The problem being delayed does indeed grow the problem, not leave it in some kind of stasis. For instance, if you look at Gamestop, assuming there is some exorbitant short-interest on the stock, throwing more equity at hedge funds is only going to allow them to delay the problem by 1) covering shorts, or 2) pushing price down with more shorts. The popularity doesn't seem to be dying off, and a steadily rising stock price means higher interest rates and more margin required in order to maintain their positions. The problem of these over-leveraged institutions just aren't working themselves out so it seems. They themselves don't have to maintain any SLRs, and so the extra influx of cash doesn't seem to be going to covering debts, but managing debts, akin to shuffling the debts around but not easing the problem."", 'This was in-line with what I was just thinking this morning.  As long as the Fed increases the limits on and access to RPR this could go on for a while. But what percentage of these RPRs is going to short banks and hedge funds that may stave off the margin call?  If they are over-leveraged accross the board the % of funds going to GME is likely also significantly reduced because they have to cover their entire portfolio.  \n\nFood for thought, anyway.', 'Thank you!', 'Great write up and thanks for that. This is not any kind of financial or legal advice. I understand why MOASS is not something they want based on your last paragraph as such can is being continuously kicked away but this can only delay the problem and now it‚Äôs getting snowball effect becoming even bigger day by day with more purchases of synthetic shares. Following could be the catalysts here:\n\nSmaller Funds that have shorted this Stonk would like to get out at this price rather at an extremely high share price and they may be slowly buying up besides retailers + FOMO buyers pushing price movement upwards. The higher price each day makes it difficult for the big short positions to manage collaterals. Even at this stage creating more synthetics can only help it push it by days or weeks but not for a long.\n\nBesides above catalyst, corporate actions like offering dividend, share recalls and may such other actions bring   MOASS one day closer.

Appreciate the effort and level of detail. While I agree with the facts we have a slightly different view point on your speculation.\n\nThis topic isn‚Äôt specifically about GME, but it does come up a lot so it‚Äôs good we‚Äôre taking time to dive deeper.\n\nTo address the money supply increase in the economy it‚Äôs important to contrast with other countries to get a more objective view. We live in a global economy after all. :)\n\nLet‚Äôs use the M2 because it includes 100% of the M1 and the M2 is broad money supply. Broad money usually affects the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n\n**M2 Money Supply Increase**\n\n2020 Jan - 2021 March\n\nUS - 29%\n\n[Canada](https://imgur.com/UqU4bpv) \\- 21%\n\n[Sweden](https://imgur.com/0ssbkLn) \\- 20%\n\n[France](https://imgur.com/pIkqBzh) \\- 19%\n\n[UK](https://imgur.com/67u6MuN) \\- 17%\n\n[Japan](https://imgur.com/eY1flEx) \\- 11%\n\n[Germany](https://imgur.com/9yk2KmH) \\- 11%\n\nThe US certainly printed more money than other countries, but I wonder if the FED printed enough relative to other countries to justify using the phrase ‚ÄòLosing faith in the dollar‚Äô because of the dollar devaluation.\n\nIf ONLY the US printed a ton of money then yes I would agree with you and the situation would be similar to Venezuela, but many central banks printed money during COVID.\n\n[Let‚Äôs take a look at the G4 central banks balance sheet.](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/peacockfedecbassets.pdf)\n\nFED (US) - 4.1T to 7.7T around a 88% increase\n\nECB (Europe) - 5T to 9.1T around a 82% increase\n\nBOJ (Japan) - 5.2T to 6.6T around a 27% increase\n\nPBOC (China) - 5.1T to 5.9T around a 16% increase\n\nSo what‚Äôs the alternative to the US dollar as the world's reserve currency?\n\nChinese yuan? EU Euro? Japanese Yen?\n\nThere isn‚Äôt a better alternative. I'll be happy to go more in detail why those 3 currencies aren't great alternatives. Just let me know :)\n\nThe real issue here isn't the dollar losing value but fiat currencies overall losing value. This is called fiat currency debasement. Perhaps Crypo will eventually be a better alternative, but this is a topic for a different time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Utilization of T-Bonds as Risk-Free collateral in the creation of synthetic equities\n\nThis is a smart conclusion, but unfortunately it doesn't quite fit for me to be convinced. :)\n\nIf I'm understanding this correctly a [synthetic stock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvO0RGsh688) requires the risk-free T-bond to offset the cost of carry(theta decay), but because the T-bonds from the reverse repos are only 1 day they probably won't receive the fixed interest. [Treasury bonds pay a fixed interest rate on a semi-annual basis.](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/how-often-do-treasury-bonds-pay-interest/) Let me know if I missed something here. :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Satisfying settlements on outstanding T-Bond short positions\n\nThe highest price of 10 Year Treasury Futures was around 140 and the lowest was around 131. This is a 6.42% max profit if you perfectly timed the short.\n\nShorting T-bonds for profit doesn't really make sense here. Through a leveraged ETF like Burry? Sure, but not by shorting the T-bond itself.\n\nEspecially considering that the US dollar won't actually lose a ton of value vs the other fiat currencies. **They will all lose value.**\n\nShorting to hedge makes perfect sense when Japan was selling a ton of bonds. Many institutions had no idea what was happening and needed to hedge quickly. This led to a temporary storage of T-bonds from high demand and negative interest rates.\n\n[The FED confirmed this here.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20210428.htm)\n\n>the staff noted that such a facility could limit the propensity for foreign official institutions to execute large sales of U.S. Treasury securities in a stress environment that, in turn, could exacerbate strains in broader U.S. domestic financial markets\n\nIt's interesting because when the FED was buying a ton of T-bonds no one was questioning the motive. Everyone was like QE - yeah that makes perfect sense.\n\nNow that QE isn't required and there are inflation concerns the FED is doing the opposite, but now there is a conspiracy behind this? If anything the real conspiracy is fiat currency debasement rather than the FED dealing with inflation.\n\nI mean - inflation is a real concern and how else would the FED deal with it?\n\nGoing to change the flair to reviewed DD because there's a lot of great research in here even if not directly related to GME! Appreciate your effort, level of detail and objective point of view! :)\n\nEDIT: typos"", 'This is exactly my thought. Beutifully organised, u/leisure_rules!\n\nThis is the logical counter-measure I¬¥d do to fight against an uncontrolled inflation getting out of hands, imho.\n\nI do not think this is intrinsically GME-related though, just some collateral issue with SHFs', 'Great job, ape üöÄüíéü§ù', ""Part of the conclusion doesn't make sense to me. There is no way the government believes that this whole thing can be staved off forever by unlimited 'patchwork' when it comes to the collateral and equity crisis. The problem being delayed does indeed grow the problem, not leave it in some kind of stasis. For instance, if you look at Gamestop, assuming there is some exorbitant short-interest on the stock, throwing more equity at hedge funds is only going to allow them to delay the problem by 1) covering shorts, or 2) pushing price down with more shorts. The popularity doesn't seem to be dying off, and a steadily rising stock price means higher interest rates and more margin required in order to maintain their positions. The problem of these over-leveraged institutions just aren't working themselves out so it seems. They themselves don't have to maintain any SLRs, and so the extra influx of cash doesn't seem to be going to covering debts, but managing debts, akin to shuffling the debts around but not easing the problem."", 'This was in-line with what I was just thinking this morning.  As long as the Fed increases the limits on and access to RPR this could go on for a while. But what percentage of these RPRs is going to short banks and hedge funds that may stave off the margin call?  If they are over-leveraged accross the board the % of funds going to GME is likely also significantly reduced because they have to cover their entire portfolio.  \n\nFood for thought, anyway.', 'Thank you!', 'Great write up and thanks for that. This is not any kind of financial or legal advice. I understand why MOASS is not something they want based on your last paragraph as such can is being continuously kicked away but this can only delay the problem and now it‚Äôs getting snowball effect becoming even bigger day by day with more purchases of synthetic shares. Following could be the catalysts here:\n\nSmaller Funds that have shorted this Stonk would like to get out at this price rather at an extremely high share price and they may be slowly buying up besides retailers + FOMO buyers pushing price movement upwards. The higher price each day makes it difficult for the big short positions to manage collaterals. Even at this stage creating more synthetics can only help it push it by days or weeks but not for a long.\n\nBesides above catalyst, corporate actions like offering dividend, share recalls and may such other actions bring   MOASS one day closer.
